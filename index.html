  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-info text-dark">With IR 4.0 technology being rapidly adopted across all industries and trades, the job roles are also transitioning from the traditional ones. To quickly adapt to this transition in the job market and be ready to take up the available jobs, getting the right set of skills needed for these jobs is of utmost importance. The most ubiquitous new job roles are related to the technologies of Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, and Web Design, hence the modules being delivered in this program are also related to these skills. </div>
